title: Creating Modules
---

There are two types of modules in IceFramework.
	- **admin**: modules which are accessible by Admins and sometimes Managers
	- **modules** modules which can be accessed by all user levels. Any user how doesn't have a Profile attached to them won't have access to these modules
